Ancient Alpine glaciers have carved a fascinating landscape of piedmont lakes, glacial valleys and mountain cirques. Using a previous supercomputer simulation of glacier flow, we show that glacier erosion has constantly evolved and moved to different parts of the Alps. Interestingly, larger glaciers do not always cause more rapid erosion. Instead, glacier erosion is modelled to slow down during glacier advance and to peak during phases of retreat, such as Earth currently undergoes.
