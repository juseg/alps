Dear Janina,

Thank you for the proof and language changes files. Please find below the response to the language editor and your comments. I used the bibtex format for references. I have nothing else in the proofs to comment on.

## Remarks from the language copy-editor

> CE1 This abbreviation is only used once. Is it well known, or should it be defined for clarity?

MIS stands for "marine oxygen isotope stages". It would be worth to define the abbreviation here indeed, because it is also used within the figures.

> CE2 Please check the use of “cf.” (i.e. “compare”) throughout. Do you mean “see” or “compare”? If you mean “see”, then it should be changed to “see” throughout.

I think we have overused "cf." indeed. I suggest the following replacements except for one instance where we truly mean "compare"

* p.3 l.90 (cf. Seguinot et al., 2018) -> (Seguinot et al., 2018)
* p.5 l.19 (cf. Hallet, ...) -> (e.g. Hallet, ...)
* p.6 l.17 (cf. Werder, ...) as in "compare our methods with"
* Fig. 5 (cf. Seguinot et al., 2018) -> (Seguinot et al., 2018)
* Fig. 7 (cf. Seguinot, ...) -> (see Seguinot, ...)

> CE3 Should this be High Tauern?

Yes, this is correct.

## Remarks from the typesetter

> TS1 Please provide a reference list entry including creators, title, and date of last access.

PISM is an open-source community project with an evolving list of authors. The reference "the PISM authors, 2017" can be used here. This is the format recommended by the project (https://github.com/pism/pism/blob/master/ACKNOWLEDGE.rst). As mentioned in the methods the version used in our study correspond to commit number e9d2d1f (https://github.com/pism/pism/commit/e9d2d1f). This version dates from 8 March 2017, which can be considered as the last access date.

> TS2 Please provide last access date.
