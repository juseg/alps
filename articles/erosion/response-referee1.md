# Authors' response to Anonymous Referee #1

Dear Anonymous Referee #1,

Thank you very much for your detailed review of our manuscript.

> The study of Seguinot and Delaney presents a time-integrated model on the
> glacial erosion potential over the last 120 ka in the Alps. Authors tie the
> calculations on a previous study by Seguinot et 2018 who modeled the glacial
> extend over Alps’ last glacial cycle by testing three different records on
> palaeo-temperature (GRIP, EPICA, and MD01-2444). Calculated basal velocities
> which base on the Parallel Ice Sheet Model PISM were used to test different
> glacial postulated erosional laws (Koppes et al., 2015; Herman et al., 2015,
> Humphrey and Raymond, 1994; Cook et al., 2020) focusing on the Rhine glacier
> area.

> The main achievement of the study is to combine a realistic, high-resolution
> model of glacial extension over a glacial cycle in a mountain range with
> assumptions on glacial erosion. Even though the utilized PISM code does not
> account for feedbacks of glacial erosion on bed topography, which makes it
> not directly comparable with common landscape codes on glacial erosion (e.g.
> Egholm et al. 2009; Sternai, et al., 2013), some relevant findings could be
> derived by this integrated high-resolution approach. This includes the
> observation of low erosion during glacier advance and maximum glacier
> extension, and the role of profile steeping during deglaciation and related
> increasing erosion rates.


## General comments

> Authors decided to keep the paper short, referring most information on
> glacial model set up and resulting ice cover to the Seguinot et 2018 paper.
> This makes it no always very easy to read and needs checking in the original
> manuscript (for example, ice cover deviations model – field bases LGM
> extension).

> The introduction gives a nice, relatively long (in relation to other
> chapters) overview on different aspects of glacial erosion and resulting
> features, and guides through problems to investigate them. Here, I don’t see
> very clear how different aspects or parts in the introduction are
> specifically addressed in this study, i.e. which problems are exactly aimed
> to be solved of this large portfolio of mentioned gaps in the understanding
> of glacial processes. I think this could be better formulated and balanced.

TODO: maybe remove some parts of the introduction? Ian?

> I think the study could also well contribute to the discussion on the
> elevation distribution of the cumulative glacial erosion over several cycles
> in the Alps (high elevations vs low elevation, e.g. Valla et al., 2011). A

TODO: try and compute cumulative erosion by elevation bins.

TODO: I think this will best fit in "age of the glacial landscape".

## Specific comments

> Line 24 Maybe a bit odd to use 4 very old references from the Alps only (you
> hardly used more than 2 references throughout the MS and there are also high
> variety of glacial landforms in other mt ranges as you mentioned).

We agree the references are not directly relevant. The citation was reduced to
the latest reference by Penck (1905) and moved within the sentence to clarify
that it is specific to the Alps.

> Line 33 I think that’s not very easy to understand what landform you refer
> to? The “periglacial blockfields topped by glacial erratic boulders” (Wirsig
> et al., 2018)? Eventually be more precise on this would help readers.

Agreed. "Characteristic landform preservation" was replaced with "preserved
periglacial blockfields".

> Line 101 Could be misleading as (glacial and periglacial) cirque erosion
> processes are not really covered by any glacial erosion law discussed here
> (or any other I am aware of, Sanders et al., 2012).

Thank you for pointing out this study. The lack of cirque erosion processes was
acknowledged and the reference added in this sentence, as well as in the
relevant part of the discussion on the age of the glacial landscape.

> Line 116  ..while much OF the intra-montane..

Corrected.

> Line 127 Higher precipitation increases ice flux and thus erosion, I guess?
> Would eventually helpful to mention (even though it might be referred in
> Seguinot et al., 2018).

Indeed. The increase in ice discharge was made explicit.

TODO: check the numbers here. Make sure that the maps (a-d) fit the profiles
(e-h), and then think again how to address the comment.

TODO: discuss uncertainty with sliding.

The following sentence was addedin this paragraph. "Nevertheless, it may
explain why some areas covered during glacial maxima only, such as some valleys
on the southern side of the Alps, appear to have experienced only little
glacial modification of their topography."

> Line 187 “time-transgressive radial pattern”. I don’t understand what you
> mean..

This sentence was only meant to recall the aforementioned results. We rephrased
to "the erosion patterns shift spatially through the glacial cycle".

> Line 195 Very much share this view!

Good to know!

> Line 197 Would recommend to be more precise. Guess you know that there are
> many, many cirques in the Alps as low as 1500 m (and even below) e.g. forming
> in areas outside the connected ice stream network in the SW and easternmost

> google earth.

The statement was reworked and restricted to "the higest mountain cirques".

> In the MS the word “yet” is very often used. Eventually consider reducing.
> The frequency is a bit irritating when reading.

In several instances we replaced "yet" with "but" and "however".

## Figures

The LGM outline was added on Fig. 2.

TODO: discuss shortly the discrepancy in "climate sensitivity".
TODO: I don't understand the second part of the comment.

> Fig. 5 I have to confess Fig. 5a surprises me, there are really glaciers as

Yes. This primarily concerns the southern slope of the Alps where topography
drops abruptedly from the highest peaks to deep valleys. It concerns only a few
grid cells for a given time step and is certainly not a realistic model output.

TODO: test cutting the hypsogram below a minimum number of grid cells.
