# Authors' response to Anonymous Referee #1

Dear Anonymous Referee #1,

Thank you very much for your positive comments and for your time spent
reviewing our work. We try to address your comments one by one below, and
highlight relevant changes made to the manuscript.

Thank you for this accurate summary of our paper.

Indeed, it is our deliberate choice to avoid paraphrasing or duplicating
content from the 2018 paper, where the preparation of the text and figures also
involved a different author team. We believe this is justified given that both
papers will be published open-access. Nonetheless, small additions were made.
Please see our responses to your technical comments below.

Our introduction is meant to revolve around two discussion points: the variable
imprint of glaciers on mountain topography, and the link between climate and
glacier erosion (somewhat addressed in the conclusions). This is followed by a
short methodological bibliography of process-based and empirical glacier
erosion laws, before we announce the scope of our work. A few key statements
were added to try and better tie these different sections.

Thank you for the suggestion. Figure 5 was amended with the
distribution of cumulative erosion potential over 100 m elevation bins.
The resulting plot shows that most modelled erosion occurs below 2000 m,
with the potential erosion volumes between 1000 and 2000 m elevation.

Our calculations indeed produce locally high cumulative erosion potential in
the aforementioned crystalline massifs. More accurate modelling of small-scale
glaciers would be needed to provide an accurate answer to your question. Steep
topography, though, is
likely to be part of the explanation. A more substantial discussion of the high
erosion potential values in these areas and the model limitations that hinder
interpretation was added in the "age of the glacial landscape" subsection.
This new passage reads as follow:

    The validity of the model results at high elevation is discussable.
    Crystalline massifs such as the Ecrins, Gran Paradiso, Monte Rosa, Aare,
    Ötztal and Tauern Massifs locally exhibit a strikingly high erosion
    potential. However, the computation of glacier flow velocities on such
    steep surfaces is strongly limited by the model horizontal resolution of
    1\,km, the shallow-ice glacier flow physics (Imhof et al., 2019), and
    PISM's current mass-conservation heuristics (Imhof, 2021). Besides,
    bergschrund (rimaye) processes likely to dominate interglacial cirque
    erosion at such altitudes (Sanders et al., 2012) are not captured by the
    velocity-based glacier erosion power-laws.


## Specific comments

We agree that the references are not directly relevant. The citation was
reduced to the latest reference by Penck (1905) and moved within the sentence
to clarify that it is specific to the Alps.

> Line 33 I think that’s not very easy to understand what landform you refer

Agreed. "Characteristic landform preservation" was replaced with "preserved
periglacial blockfields topped by erratic boulders".

Thank you for pointing out this study. This particular sentenced was reworked
to acknowledge not only the limiting resolution but also the lack of relevant
erosion erosion processes. The reference was additionally incorporated in the
relevant part of the discussion (see general comments above).

> Line 116  ..while much OF the intra-montane..

Thanks. Corrected.

Indeed. The increase in ice discharge was made explicit.

This sentence was about the amplitude of the cumulative erosion potential, but
we were probably a bit too fast deeming one erosion law "more realistic" than
the others. We are not sure what the cumulative erosion potential of the last
glacial cycle should be. Based on the estimates of total Pleistocene glacial
relief from the suggested references, we now argue that no tested erosion law
give results in the expectable range of last glacial cycle erosion.

    With a total Pleistocene glacial relief on the order of a kilometre
    (Preusser et al., 2011; Valla et al., 2011), a cumulative glacial erosion
    for the last glacial cycle in the order of 10 to 100 m can be expected.
    However, none of the tested erosion power-laws fall within this range.
    Instead, the erosion law calibrated on tidewater glaciers (Koppes et al.,
    2015) yields cumulative erosion in the Rhine Valley in the orders of
    metres, while the three erosion laws based on terrestrial glaciers
    (Humphrey and Raymond, 1994; Herman et al., 2015; Cook et al., 2020},
    result in kilometre-scale integrated erosion potential. During the Last
    Glacial Maximum and much of the last glacial cycle, Alpine paleoglaciers
    were closer in size, slope (an important parameter as we argue in the next
    section), and climatic context to the present-day glaciers of Patagonia and
    the Antarctic Peninsula (Koppes et al., 2015) than to Franz-Joseph Glacier
    (Herman et al., 2015) and many of the glaciers included in the global
    compilation by Cook et al., (2020). This may help to explain why the
    reality appears to fall in-between the tested erosion laws.

Regarding Fig. 7, there is no mismatch between panels (a-d) and (e-h), but to
improve readability we have reduced the number of colour levels on the maps,
and changed the positions of ticks on the transects.

A paragraph was added under "choice of erosion law" to discuss the
uncertainties on glacier sliding physics. Also including suggestions from
reviewer #2, the new paragraph reads as follow:

    The modelled pattern of erosion potential depends on PISM glacier physics
    and sliding model parameters. In particular, the pseudo-plastic sliding law
    exponent (q=0.25 in Seguinot et al., 2018) controls the sharpness of the
    transition between adherent and decoupled basal conditions. Recent ensemble
    validation of Antarctic Ice Sheet glacial-cycle simulations against
    geological and present-day observations (Albrecht et al., 2020a, b) support
    a higher value of q=0.75, and thus a sliding law closer to linear, which
    would perhaps result in a smoother distribution of sliding velocity and
    erosion potential. Lateral stress gradients missing from the shallow-shelf
    approximation stress balance could also contribute to moderate sliding
    velocity in narrow troughs (Herman et al., 2011; Egholm et al, 2012a, b;
    Pedersen et al., 2014).

Thank you for pointing this out. The following sentence was added in this
paragraph:

    Nevertheless, it may explain why some areas covered during glacial maxima
    only, such as some valleys on the southern side of the Alps, appear to have
    experienced only little glacial modification of their topography.

> Line 187 “time-transgressive radial pattern”. I don’t understand what you
> mean..

This sentence was only meant to recall the aforementioned results. We rephrased
to "the potential erosion patterns experience spatial shifts through the
glacial cycle".

> Line 195 Very much share this view!

Good to know!

The statement was reworked and restricted to "the highest mountain cirques".

In several instances we replaced "yet" with "but" and "however".


## Figures

The field-based LGM outline was added on Fig. 2. Computing a percent overlap is
not straightforward. As for Fig. 4 in the 2018 paper, we use a manually
modified version of the Ehlers et al. (2011) data. The original data presents
numerous, expansive nunataks, many of which are found in accumulation area and
thus directly incompatible with the mass-balance scheme used in the 2018 paper.
However, the general eastward bias was discussed in two new sentences:

    It should be noted, however, that all runs presented here show a systematic
    bias with excessive glacier cover in the Eastern Alps and a diminished
    glacier extent in the Western Alps (Fig. 2a; further discussed in Seguinot
    et al., 2018). Thus the modelled patterns of erosion potential certainly
    includes a similar bias.

> 2018 model?

This is correct. It concerns only a small number of grid cells, primarily
located on the southern slope of the Alps where topography drops abruptly from
the highest peaks to deep valleys. This information was added to the plot by
hatching the regions with fewer than a hundred ice-covered grid cells per
elevation band. This
highlights that low-elevation values are not always representative, as can also
be confirmed in the new subplot showing the distribution of cumulative erosion
potential over 100 m elevation bins. The distribution of glacier cover per
elevation band over time (from which the hundred-cell contour was extracted)
will be included in a new version of the companion dataset.


## References not in the manuscript:

In addition to the aforementioned changes, the Sternai et al. (2013) reference
was added in the discussion of the vertical distribution of erosion with this
new sentence:

    Over longer timescales, though, the vertical distribution of erosion rates
    also depends on the erosional modification of topography (Sternai et al.,
    2013).

Thank you again for taking the time to read our work and to give constructive
feedback in these troubled times. We hope that you will find our answers
satisfactory, apologize for the delay and will soon be submitting a revised
and, we believe, improved manuscript including the aforementioned suggested
changes.
