Dear Dagmar,

As I wrote yesterday I am a bit confused about "last access" dates, especially
for supplementary materials. I give publication / download dates below but I
am not sure what exactly is expected, and this issue comes up every time I
publish a paper, so I'd be really happy if you can explain.

Please find corrected figures attached and my responses below. Thank you very
much for your work.

Regards,
Julien.

Remarks from the typesetter
---------------------------

 - TS1 I could not find any new figures attached to your email with
   corrections.

   I am very sorry for forgetting the attachment in my previous email. This
   time I attach the new figures 5 and 6 for real.

 - TS2 Please explain the "Mo", "Go", and "To" in each of the parentheses.

   Sorry, I meant MB (megabytes), GB (gigabytes), and TB (terabytes).

 - TS3 Please note that this item and the following one will be deleted as
   these are not references.

   I have addressed this point in the previous iteration. Please see my
   previous comment with and updated line number below. Let me know if anything
   is unclear about it.

   "Sorry for the confusion, there are two problems here:
    * The reference to Ehlers and Gibbard (2004) is an error. It appears on
      p.~10, l.~7, and can be replaced with the more up-to-date reference to
      Ehlers et al. (2011).
    * The reference to Ehlers et al. (2011) is here because (a) it is the
      volume containing papers referred to at TS4, TS6 and TS20, and (b) the
      ice margin reconstruction that appears on Figs.~3, 4, and 7 and is
      discussed many times in the text is provided (among many other files) as
      supplementary data to that volume
      (https://booksite.elsevier.com/9780444534477/). This is a bit of a
      problem, because Ehlers et al. are not the actual authors of that data,
      the url above is not permanent, and no metadata are provided.  If you
      have a suggestion on how to deal with this I would be glad!"
