Dear Anja,

Thank you very much for jumping in! About you comment:

 * There is an error (from my side) in the text (previously mentioned to your
   colleague). On p. 10, l 7, could you please help me to replace the citation
   to "Ehlers and Gibbard, 2004" to "Ehlers et al., 2011". Then, "Ehlers and
  G ibbard, 2004" can be removed from the reference list.

 * Actually all my "Ehlers et al, 2011" citations in the text concern the data
   rather the book. Although I refer to your judgment for appropriate
   formatting, the complete reference could be something like:

   Ehlers, J., Gibbard, P. L., and Hughes, P. D. (Eds.): supplementary data to
   Quaternary glaciations - extent and chronology, a closer look, vol. 15 of
   Dev. Quaternary Sci., Elsevier, Amsterdam, 2011,
   https://booksite.elsevier.com/9780444534477, last access [data downloaded
   on] Wed Feb 10 20:51:05 UTC 2016 [but the website still works today,
   although I have not checked the data].

 * I have also cited some of the book chapters, and wonder if the volume title
   "Quaternary Glaciations..." needs to be added there too (e.g. p.17, l. 20:
   Buoncristiani et al., 2011). The volume title was included in my bibtex file
   but not processed by the copernicus.bst style file.

I think your colleague Dagmar also wanted to add the last access months in the
reference list (you may find that information in my previous email to him).

Let me know if you need anything else from me,
Julien.
