Dear Dagmar,

Thank you very much for your explanation on last access dates and for
exchanging the figure. However, I don't understand: this last version (4) has
the same notes as the previous version (3). I think there must be an error.

Regards,
Julien.

Dear Dagmar,

Sorry, maybe my previous email is unclear: I mean that the "remarks from the
language copy-editor" and the "remarks from the typesetter" at the end of the
pdf are exactly the same for versions 3 and 4.

Regards,
Julien.

Dear Dagmar,

OK thanks, the figures look good. I am waiting for version 5 then.

Best regards,
Julien.

Dear Dagmar,

Thank you for your email but I don't see any new version!

The last version is version 4 from Sep 27, which has the same comments as the
previous version 3 from Sep 25, which I have answered in an email to you from
Sep 26 (contents copied below). I have already explained this problem in
another email on Sep 27. Can we please move on?

If possible, could you estimate the date of publication (for planning of press
releases and my holidays)?

Regards,
Julien.
