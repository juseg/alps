Dear Dagmar,

I am very sorry for the late reply. I live in Sapporo and we had an earthquake
and power disruptions recently. Thank you very much for your detailed work on
our manuscript. I adress your comments below.


Remarks from the author
-----------------------

 - As explained in a previous email, an error has been found in Figs. 5 and 6.
   I attach new figures to this email.

 - Selected model output data have been made available. I suggest to replace
   the sentence on pending DOI applications by: "Aggregated variables used in
   the figures (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1423160, 35 Mo) and a subset of
   continuous model variables (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1423176, 1 Go)
   have been made available. Original model output (1.8 To) will be stored by
   the first author for a limited time."

 - On p. 9, l. 36, I have found an erroneous reference to Jouvet et al.
   (2017b). This paper on Greenland which is not relevant here. Could you
   please correct my mistake and replace by Jouvet et al. (2017a), which is the
   only "Jouvet et al." which should appear here.

 - In the reference list, I found a typo. Three papers are listed as published
   in "Sience" instead of "Science". Could you please correct my mistake here
   as well?


Remarks from the language copy-editor
-------------------------------------

 - CE1 Please note that Fig. 4–7 were changed during copy-editing. Please review
   the figure content carefully.

   OK.

 - CE2 It is our house standard to restrict italics to newly introduced terms
   for the majority of cases. For this reason, italics have been removed in some
   instances in this paper.

   OK.

 - CE3 We have changed this unit to ’kyr’ to denote duration. ’ka’ is used for
   dates. Please confirm consistency.

   OK.

 - CE4 Changed capitalization for consistency with previous use.

   OK.

 - CE5 Please edit the reference as recommended at
   https://github.com/pism/pism/blob/master/ACKNOWLEDGE.rst.

   I am already using this template except for the date of 2017, which
   corresponds to the version used in this study
   (https://github.com/pism/pism/commit/e9d2d1f).

 - CE6 Please confirm this change for clarity

   The meaning of the sentenced was altered. With "equilibrium ice and bedrock
   temperature" I mean "equilibrium temperature in the ice and in the bedrock".

 - CE7 Is “similarity method” a section heading in the reference or does it
   describe the contents of the article?

   The article by Goutorbe et al. contains geothermal reconstructions using
   two different methods. The one I used is based on the method labelled
   "similarity method" in figures, subsections etc.

 - CE8 Is it the elastic thickness or the simulations that are introducing the
   change in length?

   It is the change in elastic thickness which "introduces" a change in length.
   Maybe the sentence would be clearer with "thus introducing".

 - CE9 Please confirm this change.

   OK, my mistake.

 - CE10 Please confirm that this did not change your meaning.

   In fact it did. I mean that the retreat of terminal lobes is synchronous
   with lowering of ice surface in the mountains, not necesseraly causing it.


Remarks from the typesetter
---------------------------

 - TS1 Copernicus Publications collects the DOIs of data sets, videos, samples,
   model code, and other supplementary/underlying material or resources as
   well as additional outputs. These assets should be added to the reference
   list (author(s), title, DOI, and year) and properly cited in the article. If
   no DOI can be registered, assets can be linked through persistent URLs. This
   is not seen as best practice and the persistence of the URL must be secured.

   I am not sure which is the proper reference format, but the data have now
   been published as:
    * Seguinot, Julien (2018). Alpine ice sheet glacial cycle simulations
      aggregated variables [Data set]. Zenodo.
      http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1423160
    * Seguinot, Julien (2018). Alpine ice sheet glacial cycle simulations
      continuous variables [Data set]. Zenodo.
      http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1423176
   The supplementary video (also see following comment) as:
    * Seguinot, Julien (2018). Modelling last glacial cycle ice dynamics in the
      Alps. German National Library of Science and Technology (TIB) AV-Portal.
      https://doi.org/10.5446/35164

 - TS2 The composition of Figs. 1, 2 and 4-7 has been adjusted to our standards.

   OK.

 - TS3 Please explain. I am not sure what kind of "supplement" you are talking
   about.

   Sorry for the confusion. I mean the video abstract. Because the video is now
   hosted at TIB (https://doi.org/10.5446/35164), I did not include it as a
   supplement during the resubmission. I was not sure how to reference it now.

 - TS4 Please note that the DOI leads to the journal "Developments in
   Quaternary Sciences", it is chapter 29.

   Correct. This is a book series rather than a journal. Detailed information
   is missing here because I have used Bibtex cross-references. See also TS9.

 - TS5 Please note the update.

   OK. Thanks.

 - TS6 Please note that the DOI leads to the journal "Developments in
   Quaternary Sciences", it is chapter 10.

   Correct. This is a book series rather than a journal. Detailed information
   is missing here because I have used Bibtex cross-references. See also TS9.

 - TS7 Please provide the publisher and its location.

   The map was published as part of an Atlas. The full reference is:

      Castiglioni B (1940) L’Italia nell’età quaternaria. Carta delle Alpi nel
      Glaciale (1:200 000 scale). In: Dainelli G (ed) Atlante fisico-economico
      d’Italia, Consociazione Turistica Italiana, Milano, Italy, Table 3.

 - TS8 Please confirm the inserted information.

   OK.

 - TS9 Please note that this item and the following one will be deleted as these
   are not references.

   Sorry for the confusion, there are two problems here:
    * The reference to Ehlers and Gibbard (2004) is an error. It appears on
      p.~10, l.~30, and can be replaced with the more up-to-date reference to
      Ehlers et al. (2011).
    * The reference to Ehlers et al. (2011) is here because (a) it is the
      volume countaining papers refered to at TS4, TS6 and TS20, and (b) the
      ice margin reconstruction that appears on Figs.~3, 4, and 7 and is
      discussed many times in the text is provided (among many other files) as
      supplementary data to that volume
      (https://booksite.elsevier.com/9780444534477/). This is a bit of a
      problem, because Ehlers et al. are not the actual authors of that data,
      the url above is not permanent, and no metadata are provided.  If you
      have a suggestion on how to deal with this I would be glad!

 - TS10 Please provide the volume and check the DOI number.

   This is volume 48 as provided, alhough the DOI link appears not to work
   (https://www.eg-quaternary-sci-j.net/48/23/1998).

 - TS11 Please provide the location of the institution.

   The swisstopo institution is located in Wabern, Switzerland.
   (https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/de/home/meta/kontakt.html).

 - TS12 Please provide the number and pages of the report.

   The report contains 120 pages.

 - TS13 Please confirm the inserted information.

   OK

 - TS14 Please provide this information.

 - TS15 Please provide the location of the publisher.

   The publisher is located in Cambridge, UK.

 - TS16 Please provide this information.

   Natural Earth data last accessed in 2017.

 - TS17 Please provide this information.

   I am not sure, technically last acesssed in 2014 since this is my thesis
   and the file is also on my computer. But isn't the URN a fixed identifier?

 - TS18 Please provide this information.

   PISM source code last acessed 2017.

 - TS19 Please provide this information.

   The url appears no more valid. This document can now be found at

   Last acessed in 2018.

 - TS20 Please note that the DOI leads to the journal "Developments in
   Quaternary Sciences", it is chapter 2.

   Correct. This is a book series rather than a journal. Detailed information
   is missing here because I have used Bibtex cross-references. See also TS9.

 - TS21 Please provide the publisher and pages.

   The title page has no mention of a publisher. This essay was probably
   self-published. Total 38 pages (https://doc.rero.ch/record/17203).

 - TS22 Please provide the location of the publisher.

   These two letters have a complex history. They were originally written in
   French in 1941 and 1942. They were subsequently edited, translated and first
   printed in English by the Royal Society, London at the demand of the author
   of the second letter Pierre Martel, Peter in the English version, and
   distributed by several libraries. Can we consider the Royal Society (London,
   UK) as publisher? The original version in French was only recovered and
   published much later by Téophile Dufour in 1879.
