Abstract
   About 25000 years ago, Alpine Glaciers filled most of the valleys and even
   extended onto the plains. Using a computer model that contains knowledge on
   glacier physics based on modern observations of Greenland and Antarctica and
   laboratory experiments on ice, help from traces left by glaciers on the
   landscape, and one of the fastest computers in the world, this animation is
   an attempt to reconstruct of the evolution of Alpine Glaciers in time from
   120000 years ago to today.
