Abstract:
   This animation shows the vertical distribution of modelled glacier erosion
   in a simulation of glacier changes and glacier erosion in the Alps
   (https://vimeo.com/503162771). Each dot on the left panel represents a model
   grid cell, with fixed (current) bed altitude and varying glacier erosion
   rate. The right panels shows the number of grid cells that are ice-covered
   in 100-metre elevation bands, the corresponding ice volume grounded at these
   elevations and the corresponding glacier erosion volume in the model. Rapid
   erosion is localized at low elevation during glacial maxima, but spreads to
   higher elevations when the glaciers retreat.
