   Last glacial cycle glacier erosion potential in the Alps,
   $\it{Earth\ Surface\ Dynamics\ Discussions}$, 2021.

Abstract:
   The fascinating glacial erosion landscape of the Alps is a result of
   multiple cycles of glacier advance and retreat. This animation is an attempt
   to visualize the time-evolving patterns of Alpine Glaciers erosion potential
   from 120000 years ago to the present. Glacier erosion, however, is very
   difficult to measure, let alone to predict. The numbers are based on measured
   glacier sediment accumulations in Patagonian and Antarctic Peninsula fjords,
   which may not be valid in the Alps. The animation neither includes glacier
   changes as a result of eroded topography, nor additional erosion caused by
   rivers between phases of glaciation.
