Abstract:
   This animation shows the modelled erosion rates and annual erosion volume in
   a simulation of glacier changes and glacier erosion in the Alps
   (https://vimeo.com/503162771). Interestingly, the volume of materials
   predicted by the model to be carved out by glaciers does not scale up with
   the total volume of glaciers in the Alps. Instead, glacier erosion slows
   down during periods of glacier advance, and it accelerates during periods of
   glacier retreat. These variations are caused by changes in the ice
   temperature, which control the speed at which glaciers flow on their bed.
