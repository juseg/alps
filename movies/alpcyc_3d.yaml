Abstract:
   For the last two million years, Alpine Glaciers have constantly extended in
   and out of their valleys, coming and going onto the plains. Unlike the
   current glacier retreat due to increased carbon dioxide concentrations,
   these changes were governed by long-term climatic cycles associated with
   changes in the Earth's orbit and rotation axis. Studying these natural, past
   glacial periods helps us understand and predict the long-term glacier
   retreat due to man-made climate warming.

   This animation shows a simulation of glacier advance and retreat during the
   last glacial cycle in the Alps, itself consisting of multiple phases of
   advance and retreat, called stadials and interstadials, whose timing can
   vary from one valley to the next depending on the glacier response time. It
   uses a computer model that contains knowledge on glacier physics based on
   modern observations of Greenland and Antarctica and laboratory experiments
   on ice, help from traces left by glaciers on the landscape, and one of the
   fastest computers in the world, this animation is an attempt to reconstruct
   of the evolution of Alpine Glaciers in time from 120000 years ago to today.
