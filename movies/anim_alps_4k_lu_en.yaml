Abstract:
   About 25000 years ago, Alpine Glaciers filled most of the valleys and even
   extended onto the plains. Using a computer model that contains knowledge on
   glacier physics based on modern observations of Greenland and Antarctica and
   laboratory experiments on ice, help from traces left by glaciers on the
   landscape, and one of the fastest computers in the world, this animation is
   an attempt to reconstruct the advance and retreat of the Reuss and Linth
   glaciers during the Last Glacial Maximum.
